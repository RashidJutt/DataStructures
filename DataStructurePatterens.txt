Data Structure Patterens.

Prefix Sum: 
Precomputed accumulated sum till index i. 
Used to answer subarrays queries when we need portion of array accourding to required condition we first think in prefix sum direction. 
We efficiently stored precomputed sums and then used them with mathical equation to identify required portions. 
We build prefixSum data with O(n) and Query with O(1) complexity. 
When we have to calculate length we start with sum[0]=-1; 
When we have to calculate number of subarrays then we strart with sum[0]=1;

Example Problems: 
Leet code 303: Range Sum Query â€“ Immutable
=>Prefix sum extentions: 
=>Prefix with HashMap. 
	We combile Prefix sum with Hashmap we store computed sum along with index for frequescies accourding to problem and used that data to 
	identify required subarrays. 
	Example Problems: 
	Leet Code 560 Subarray sum equal to k. 
	Leet Code 1248 Count Number of nice sub arrays. sum of odd numbers - k already exist then its subarray that has k odd numbers.
	LC 930: Binary Subarrays With Sum
	LC 437: Path Sum III (tree version of subarray sum = k)
	Key to solve path sum problem is that we have to use depth first search and remove sums on end of path. 
	we store sums in same way and use recursion to treverse in tree and clean sums dictionary when one path is completed. 
	Performance of multidimential array is more then dictionary and performance of jagged array is more then multidimentional array. due to contigeous memory and less boundry constraints.
